1.Getting Started
Anaconda and Spyder

2. Hello World
print("Hello World!")

3. Variables
Python stores data in variables. Variables are analogous to variables that you
would have experienced in mathematics.
x = 10
print(x)
y = 5
z = x + y
print(z)

y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)

Variables arenâ€™t limited to numbers. They can be any defined data type. For
example you can store a string as a variable.

my_string = "Hello World!"
print(my_string)
end_string = " -from Steve"
print(my_string + end_string)

5. Lists
Lists are a way to store an ordered collection of variables. Letâ€™s create a list
and store it in the variable my_list. Try the following by adding to your Python
Script then pressing Run

my_list = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
print(my_list)

List items can be accessed by their index. Python uses zero-indexing which
means the first item starts at 0.

print(my_list[0])
To add sth: to add items to the list you can use the append function
my_list.append(32)
To create an empty list you can use the list constructor function
my_empty_list = list()
To find out how many items are in the list use the len function
print(len(my_list))

6. Conditionals
input_number = int(input("Enter a number:"))
if input_number > 3:
print("number is greater than 3")
elif input_number == 3:
print("number is equal to 3")
else:
print("number is less than 3")
